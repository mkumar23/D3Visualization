Square root scaling is a better scaling approach as there is a vast domain of
coolness value for characters. If we use linear scale range increases linearly 
due to this some nodes have very small size whereas others are significantly large. 

when we use square root scaling increment rate reduces so large domain can be mapped.

Filtering node label on the basis of coolness level improves the graph. As it reduces 
cluttering by avoiding information which are not important. 

To make the graph more readable I made following changes:
	* adjusted the font size 
	* Link distance : Increased link distance so that nodes and edges can be distinguished.
	* Range adjustment for node size: So that smaller nodes are visible and larger ones are not overwhelming.
	* Tool tip back ground: Background of tool tip is set as white so that tool tip remain readable when hovering over other nodes.

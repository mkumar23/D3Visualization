This table is designed considering end users(Buyers) with a filter where retail price is > $70000.

	* Cars are grouped as sports and non sports.
	* Both the group has retail price in sorted order so that buyer can easily identify his price range.
	* Qualification criteria i.e. retail price is highlighted so, that it can be easily distinguished as important feature.
	* Useless quantities which is not important for a buyer is not included so that user can only focus on required parameter to make decision.
	* Important features to users like mileage are reordered in priority.

Size of graph was set such that it properly uses the available screen space and has
proper margin so that no two graph data overlaps and create confusion.

Choice of color was made by refering color brewer with following consideration.
	* Data is easily visible 
	* Data is easily distinguishable
	* For mpg comparision graph color choice was more important so that neighbouring bars can be easily distinguished.


While analyzing all cars of various companies on various parameters it would be 
important to know the range and average values of those parameters. To compare given parameters 
I have calculated min, max and the average value of the parameters and then compared their values by scatter plot.

To compare Mileage box plot have been used as it is an effective way to show range of values.
Also use of box plot is better choice for last graph because using scatter plot will create
confusion due to too many discrete points side by side.
